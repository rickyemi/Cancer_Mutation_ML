# Cancer_Mutation_Machine_Learning

In this project, we tried to carry out comparative analysis of ML classification of a number of cancer mutation scores. 
The main objective is to build a predictive model to classify  Driver-Passenger mutation while determining the optimal class boundary for the mutation label

ML algorithms : 
Classical ML algorithm
    Logit Model
Deep learning 
    Deep Neural Network
    
Logistic Regression is a classification algorithm  with a probabilistic component. 

Statistical Assumptions of Logit Model 

Assumption one: Response variable has to be binary in nature 
  In our case our response variable is the mutation type (Driver vs Passenger)
    So we represent the response variable with 0 (Driver) and  1 (Passenger)
    
Assumption two : No high intercorrelations among the predictors 
  Our mutation scores are the predictors
  
Assumption three:  Linear relationship between the logit of the outome/response variable and each predictor 


ABOUT THE DATA 

Extracted mutation from 17 subtypes where cancer is known to be present 

  Glioblastoma 
  Ovarian & Peritoneal Carcinoma
  Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma 
  Apoptosis regulation signaling pathway


Model was built using the CRISP-DM paradigm
